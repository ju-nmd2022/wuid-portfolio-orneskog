         <p><h2>About me:</h2>
            My name is Charlie Örneskog and I'm a first year New Media Design student at Jönköping University.<br/>
            I'm 32 years old and I have worked in the hospitality business for 13 years so food and wine has become a big interest of mine. <br/> </p>
        <p>I have always had an interest in design (both graphic and interior) and that is why I decided to study New Media Design.<br/>
            I also studied 'Digital Design' while studying at the Gymnasium back in 2006-2009 and it's really interesting to see how far the industry has come since then.</p>
        <p><h2>My hobbies:</h2>
